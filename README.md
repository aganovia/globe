## Project Description

An interactive solar system in Three.js. Clicking and dragging on the sphere will spin it in the direction the cursor is moving. Pressing the A and D keys on the keyboard cycles through different planets. The color of the lighting can be changed by clicking on the buttons on the screen.

## Graphics-based Technologies

The primary technology utilized is [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), a popular JavaScript 3D Library.

## Run Instructions

To run the app locally:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following commands (with node installed):
